# Web Volume "remote" control ðŸ”Š

**Update**: I've abstracted the volume management into a gem:
[volumerb](https://github.com/picandocodigo/volumerb).

This simple Sinatra app manages the volume on **GNU/Linux** systems with
[ALSA](http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page) (most
GNU/Linux distributions as far as I know) and **Mac OS X** (thanks to
[@dcadenas](https://github.com/dcadenas)).

It's basically a web page where you can interact with your computer's
volume via a browser.

## How does it work?

* Clone the code
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec puma`

You should be able to access the app on:
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)

You can manage the volume from a Browser or anything else that can do a
GET request.

### Routes

 * `up` - increases volume by 3%.
 * `down` - decreases volume by 3%.
 * `mute` - toggles mute/unmute.
 * `vol` - returns current volume and state.

All routes return a JSON with two keys: `value` and `state`. The
value is the current volume value and the state" represents if the
system volume is muted or not.

Example:
```
$ curl localhost:9292/mute
{"value":100,"state":"off"}
```
